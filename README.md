# Frontend Mentor - Meet landing page
![Design preview for the Meet landing page](./preview.jpg)

## Project Overview 📋 

This is a solution to the [Testimonials grid section challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/meet-landing-page-rbTDS6OUR).

## Built With 🛠️

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox and Grid
- **`clamp()` function** for responsive typography and spacing
- Logical CSS properties (`inline-size`, `block-size`, `margin-block`)

*I decided to try building the page layout using CSS Grid instead of creating separate containers for each section.
 I think this approach is more suitable for large and complex layouts, but I wanted to experiment and see how it works in practice.  

##  What I Learned💡
 Built a universal grid layout that adapts to new content.
   

## Reflections 💭

I came to the conclusion that CSS variables are truly useful for bigger projects.
For smaller ones, I’ll use them only where they add real value — like for colors, main fonts, or other key styles.


##  Acknowledgments 🙏
Thanks to Frontend Mentor for providing this challenge and to the community for their helpful feedback and resources on modern CSS techniques.
